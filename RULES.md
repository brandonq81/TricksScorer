#How to Play Tricks:
Tricks is a card game played by four players using a standard deck of cards (52 cards) without Jokers.  
1. Step one is to select who goes first.  
---Any random way will work. I usually have each person take a card and lowest one goes first.  
2. The person chosen to go first controls the first "kingdom".  
3. For each kingdom, the player in control gets to pick which of 5 games to play each hand.  
---Kingdoms last for 5 hands and each of the 5 games has to be played exactly once in each kingdom.
